## Easily build modular single page webapps

Besides being the italian singular for spaghetti, spaghetto is a framework that
lets you build rich client-side applications composed of different
sub-applications, or components, as we call them in spaghetto.

Spaghetto doesn't write your components, but takes care of the rest :
  - you have a full-featured [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) navigation bar :
    - with tabs and menus for your components
    - automatic shows the active component menu and hides the others
    - responsive
  - the power of [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)
  - a clear separation of components code/styling
  - local and session storage to save app settings and/or user data
  - folder hierachy allows for huge components to be built
  - easy to hack workflow written with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), already setup for :
      - [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) and [JSCS](http://jscs.info/) cor code quality and style
      - minified, compressed code [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS)
      - component styling with the powerful [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/)

And the list goes on, read the extensive documentation

All is done so you don't have to worry about setup and configuration and you can
concentrate on writing your application instead
